# Online_Store_Development
A personal project developed by myself to increase proficiency in cloud technologies (AWS Ec2, Rds, and SG), web development (CSS, html, UI), server side scripting (PHP), and database management (SQL). 

In this personal project, I wanted to learn how I can get these different technologies to work together using an MVC approach. 
  1. PHP as the back end
  2. HTML and CSS as the front end
  3. SQL as the database
  4. AWS as the hosting service for the website (EC2) and dbms (RDS) as well as who is able to acess the website (Security groups)

This website is a fully functional online store where users can 
  1. view products
  2. add, remove, or update items in a shopping cart
  3. view/ manage their order receipt
  4. ability to filter through products
  5. search through different pages

I first designed and implemented a MySQL database to handle product inventory, sessions, order transactions, and user data. 
As the Front-end, I develoved a responsive web page in HTML and CSS to ensure that the site can be accessed on multiple devices (PCs and mobile).
As the Back-end, I utilized PHP to for server-side scripting to manage user sessions (sessions > cookies), process orders, and to interact with the database.
All of this was deployed on AWS cloud services. Using EC2 for hosting, RDS for the DBMS, and SG for managing who can access the page (made it so anyone and everyone can)

The end goal of this project is to strengthen my front-end, back-end, and cloud deployment. I soon hope to get the AWS cloud practitioner cert!
